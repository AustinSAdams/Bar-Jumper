/* This page is for the "/rankings" extension on the website. It should have:
    1. Default Theme Colors.
    2. Easy to navigate menu.
    3. "Leader Board" display with bars ranked by stars on google analytics.
        Additionally, there should be buttons under each ranking that leads to 
        main page with that bar's information pulled up automatically.

    To access this page locally, after running "npm run dev", go into your web browser
    and type in "http://localhost:3000/rankings".
